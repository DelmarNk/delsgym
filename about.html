    <h1>Who's Delmar</h1>
    <p>Four years ago, I was very skinny, I only weighed 57kg and I had a sedentary lifestyle. It was not until 2021  when I started my journey into fitness by doing calisthenics then bodybuilding.</p>

    <p>It was quite a journey for me to get to where I am today. but I kept my passion, motivation and discipline, and finally reached my goals.As I've been there, I know the reason why most people give up on their fitness dreams,and that's the reason why I became a fitness trainer, to help people reach their goals; because it's very frustrating when you workout and don't get the results you need. However, the probelm is not always about persistance, in most cases, the probem comes from training and diet. A slight difference in the way you train or what you eat can make a huge difference in your progress.</p>
